## Thesis: Utilizing Plantar Thermal Imaging for Early Diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

### Dataset
- **Dataset Source:** [IEEE DataPort - Plantar Thermogram Database Study on Diabetic Foot Complications](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/plantar-thermogram-database-study-diabetic-foot-complications)
- **Description:** This dataset comprises plantar thermal images specifically curated for studying diabetic foot complications. It is accessible through IEEE DataPort.

### Machine Learning Model - EfficientDet
- **Model Overview:** EfficientDet represents a cutting-edge object detection model renowned for its efficiency and accuracy, making it highly suitable for tasks requiring precise object localization within images.
- **Implementation:** This research integrates the EfficientDet model with the plantar thermal imaging dataset to explore its potential in diagnosing and monitoring complications associated with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
